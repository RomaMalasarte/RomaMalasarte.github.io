This is my first time learning and coding with Javascript. So far, I can see that it embodies two aspects:  flexibility and accessibility. In comparison to other languages, the syntax looks clearer if used with a good understanding of the problem or concept. Java, C,and R are languages that I have dealt with in the past. They are all, including javascript, still never an easy language for me to learn in the beginning. However, when I get the hang of it, I find that each language has its own and unique wonders. For the first assignment of learning the basic syntax structure and ES6, I learned the variables of let, const, promises, and functions that utilize arrows. I am still getting the gist of the syntax, as I am not familiar, but it is cool to see the differences between languages. Javascript is a good language to learn, although it may not be as applicable or perform the same as other languages, it is nice to get a feel for it too. 

From a software engineering perspective, I believe that JavaScript would be a useful language to know. If it werenâ€™t, I doubt we would be learning it in this course, which is software engineering I. I have not been coding with JavaScript for long, but many say javaScript has the potential to provide software engineers a comprehensive view on the design and development process which is based on the statistic that JavaScript is a popular language when it comes to creating web applications. Since this class does require us to create an application using JS, we will see if my views have changed!


Athletic software engineering is interactive and engaging in a way where we need more classes that practice it. In my previous ICS classes, the style of learning is to listen and hopefully retain, and apply what we learned during our own time. However, that method is unmotivating for my learning style. After a week in this software engineering class, I found myself getting my brain actively working, which can definitely be from the pressure of the WODs. I find the practice WODs to be helpful, kind of stressful, but it is something that I believe will work for my learning style. I am looking forward to the challenges this class will bring. I may fail at times, but hopefully I can overcome them!
