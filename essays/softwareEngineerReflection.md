## _I know..._
Becoming a software engineer would be an occupation that I hope to experience one day. I think that the beauty of becoming a software engineer would be the endless things you can encounter and learn as technology is rapidly evolving. I would imagine software engineers stay updated with the latest creations and enhancements, whether it be applications, languages, structures. The evolution of technology will only advance as the years go by and engineerâ€™s contribute to the success of new features and improving user experiences, and I would like to try that out.

## _I hope..._
As an aspiring engineer, I hope to become fluent in one or more programming languages, have a better understanding of the fundamental data structures and algorithms, and enhance my problem solving abilities. I would like to improve on my technical skills and gain experience in web development and data management. Right now, my current goal is to continue working on personal projects and network with professionals to hopefully obtain a mentor in the field.

## _I will!_
I know I am on a path that will lead me to success! If the time comes and I get the opportunity to become a software engineer, I will take it. Whether I succeed or fail at times, it is the learning process, but commitment and dedication is what matters! 
allenges this class will bring. I may fail at times, but hopefully I can overcome them!

Side Note: before the class, I never knew how to use or navigate github, so that's cool! and its fun! =D
