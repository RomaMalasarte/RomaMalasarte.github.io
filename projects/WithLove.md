## _Creation_
Back in highschool, I was selling my old clothes that I could not fit anymore on a small instagram shop. For my 16th Birthday, I got a polaroid film printer. I found myself utilizing it a lot and I had always added a small polaroid photo to my friendâ€™s birthday gifts to add a personalized component. I then thought to myself, why not make this a business because some of my friends were asking if I was selling personalized film. 

From then on, I made my niche personalized polaroid film and little did I know I would be making a good amount of money through this small business doing what I enjoyed. I loved seeing how much people enjoyed the product that I continued to add value to my product. 

I was responsible for every aspect of the business. From posting my products on a consistent time schedule, packaging the orders, to customer communication, and deliveries or shipments. I engaged with my customers to understand what their wants are and essentially covered front to back operations. 

## _Valuable learnings_
I honed many entrepreneurial skills managing a small scale venture. I learned positive communication skills with customers, creative marketing, adaptability, financial literacy, and consistency. Out of the many skills I have learned, I am grateful for the confidence I had to take on this project. Although this business is closed, I'm glad that I was able to provide services and learn such skills at a young age.
