## _Thoughts on JavaScript_
This is my first time learning and coding with Javascript (JS). So far, I can see that it embodies two aspects:  flexibility and accessibility. In comparison to other languages, the syntax seems clearer if used with a good understanding of the problem or concept. The ES6 standard allows the function to be concise, so long as the operators are being used in a functional manner. Java, C++,and R are languages that I have dealt with in the past. They are all, including javascript, still never an easy language for me to learn in the beginning. However, when I get the hang of it, I find that each language has its own unique wonders. For the first assignment of learning the basic syntax structure and ES6, I learned the variables of let, const, promises, and the usage of arrows. I am still getting the gist of the syntax, as I am not familiar, but it is cool to see the differences between languages. Javascript can be a beneficial language to learn, although it may not be as applicable or perform the same as other languages (which is a good thing, because all languages differ), it would be valuable knowledge to get a sense of. 


From a software engineering perspective, I believe that JavaScript would be a useful language to know. If it werenâ€™t, I doubt we would be learning it in this course, which is software engineering I. I have not been coding with JavaScript for long, but many say javaScript has the potential to provide software engineers a comprehensive view on the design and development process. This is based on the statistic that JavaScript is a popular language when it comes to creating web applications. Since this class does require us to create an application using JS, we will see if my views have changed!

## _Learning Style_
Athletic software engineering is interactive and engaging in a way where it would be nice to have more classes that practice it. In my previous ICS classes, the style of learning is come to the lecture, listen and retain, and apply what we learned during our own time through the homework. I believe that method is unmotivating for my learning style. After a week in this software engineering class, I found my brain actively working, which can definitely be from the pressure of the WODs, but also the fact that we are going through material step by step. I find the practice WODs to be helpful, kind of stressful, but it is something that I believe will work for my learning style. I am looking forward to the challenges this class will bring. I may fail at times, but hopefully I can overcome them!
