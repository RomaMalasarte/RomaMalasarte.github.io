If I asked you the question, “does the top bread bun go below the cheese and lettuce?” Would you take me seriously?

No. 


## _Communication is Key_
Asking smart questions is an opportunity. An opportunity to gain specific information and detailed answers to expand your knowledge and make better decisions. If we can make smart goals, we can make smart questions. It is important to analyze the questions we are asking and ensure that it is specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and will it meet long term goals. Putting in effort to what you are trying to convey with research of your own and emphasizing the area of confusion will lead you to a path of effective communication, collaboration, and work. However, asking questions with little to no context, does not lead you anywhere. It is important to try and figure things out yourself, ask a friend who can help you, or utilize your resources. No matter what, when you are just stuck and unsure of what to do, or what x means, form a smart question.

## _Smart question example:_

In the following example, this person is asking what the difference is between map and object. In this question, the asker provides varying definitions from other sources, but is looking for more clarification. The asker explains their reason to confusion and concludes with the question, “Why is JavaScript gaining a (well-supported) Map object? what does it do?”
[Map vs Object in JavaScript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18541940/map-vs-object-in-javascript)

```
I just discovered this feature:

Map: Map objects are simple key/value maps.

That confused me. Regular JavaScript objects are dictionaries, so how is a Map different from a dictionary? Conceptually, they're identical (according to another question on Stack Overflow)

The documentation doesn't help either:

Map objects are collections of key/value pairs where both the keys and values may be arbitrary ECMAScript language values. A distinct key value may only occur in one key/value pair within the Map’s collection. Distinct key values as discriminated using the a comparision algorithm that is selected when the Map is created.

A Map object can iterate its elements in insertion order. Map object must be implemented using either hash tables or other mechanisms that, on average, provide access times that are sublinear on the number of elements in the collection. The data structures used in this Map objects specification is only intended to describe the required observable semantics of Map objects. It is not intended to be a viable implementation model.

…still sounds like an object to me, so clearly I've missed something.

Why is JavaScript gaining a (well-supported) Map object? What does it do?
```

I had found this as an example of a SMART question because this person showcases research and provides us with information that they have tried to figure it out themselves. Confusion is highlighted and details about what is unclear is provided. After looking at the responses from other folks and developers, they seemed engaged in the conversation and wanting to provide more for the asker.

## _Not so smart question example_
In this example, the asker is wondering how to fix an application. 
[Application not working and I dont know the reason](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58114330/application-not-working-and-i-dont-know-the-reason)

```
I have below code and once I run application it is crashed, I dont know the reason sorry Iam new on android so any one can help me

RecyclerView recyclerView;
    Button btn;
    Context context;
    ImageView imageView;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.a);
        TextView textView=findViewById(R.id.txt);
        textView.setText(getString(R.string.action_settings));
        imageView.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View view) {

            }
        });
```
As you may have analyzed, the asker provides very…very…very vague context of their issue. It is okay though, this person has two responses which hopefully were helpful. I had deemed this question as not so smart because it does not clearly describe the issue and responders seem to provide less information/ less interactive. There are no comments that give us an idea of what the code is doing or knowledge and effort that the asker has done their research on their end. This question is rough. 

## _Asking questions save time, energy, and money!_
[How to ask questions the smart way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) is definitely an important read, not just for software developers but may pertain to every individual on earth. Good questions are tools and stimulate motivation to learn. Asking smart questions is an advantage to gain another perspective and is essential to the growth process.
