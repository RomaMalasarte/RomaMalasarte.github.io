## _Role and Overview_
I take on the role as the Vice President of Marketing and I coordinate events to raise awareness about our mission and attract students from different backgrounds to foster interest in tech related initiatives. 

We host social programs where we allow folks to meet people with similar interests in the same setting. We hosted Boba & origami, movie night, painting & pastries programs so that students can feel ease throughout the semester and unwind (which many of us forget doing). We also host LinkedIn professional workshops as well as get industry professionals to talk to students about their experience within their career. 

## _Responsibilities & Accomplishments!_

It is important for our students to stay informed and stay up to date with our events throughout the semester. I create flyers that appeal and effectively communicate our club’s events and objectives. I utilize canva as a tool for me to design and create. I manage our social media account to reach a wider audience and strategize how we can get optimal engagement as a club here on campus. 

Several accomplishments that I am proud of would be creating our social media platform and hitting 100+ followers. Promoted SWITCH and tabled at many events such as the RIO club fair and ECUH Welcome back showcase. A few of my team members and I are also getting started on our pilot research study: Challenges Women Face in the IT industry here in Hawaiʻi.

Through my role as the VP of Marketing for SWITCH, I have acquired skills such as project management, coordination, graphic design, social media analytics, event planning and execution, teamwork, and most especially, becoming an advocate to support women in the tech industry. This opportunity allowed me to showcase my ability to lead with initiative.
