### I. Introduction
`About a year and a half ago, I went back home and took a visit to my uncle's house. His son, who worked as an IT and in the software developing field had asked me "where do you go to college and what are you studying?" This question was not new to me, but his response left me with confusion. As I was describing my college experience, he replied back saying that Computer Science is only advancing and now there is ChatGPT. He asked me, "have you heard of that?" I replied saying "no, what is that?" Finding myself typing in chatgpt on the web today, is surreal to me. Little did I know, something that I was 0% knowledgeable about has become applicable to my daily life. `

At the beginning of this ICS314 course, I had a relieving feeling that AI was encouraged in the course. I was worried that I will not be able to use AI, especially for software engineering which I have heard to be quite difficult and hectic that.`


### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18

I have not used AI in the experience WODs mainly because they are trial for me to test whether I understand the concept and woul be able to code it on my own.

  2. In-class Practice WODs

I have not used AI in in class practice WODs as I am able to get ideas from my partners and come up with 

  3. In-class WODs

I have used AI in the in class WODs 

  4. Essays

I do use AI for my essays, specifically Grammarly, 

  5. Final project

Yes, I have used AI in my final project for debugging using github copilot

  6. Learning a concept / tutorial

YEs, but i try to read the documentation as they are more interesting than chatgpt

  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord

no, I have not answered a question in class or in discord 

  8. Asking or answering a smart-question

no, I have not used AI to ask or answer a smart question

  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

I may have once, but it was a rare occasion since all the documentation was provided and accessible 

  10. Explaining code

Yes, I deifnitely have used AI to explain code, especially in a time crunch. 

  11. Writing code

Yes, I have asked AI to write example code or code that is relevant to what I am working on 

  12. Documenting code

No

  13. Quality assurance

yes

  14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above

other than what has been listed above, I believe that 


### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:
I am still trying to figure out where I stand with the incorporation of AI in my day to day learning experience. I want it to become a valuable resource, but i don’t want to take advantage of it and lose my values in true learning. AI does help me apply in an efficient manner, but it does not help me retain. That is my observation. In my case, I prefer reading the documentation and looking at examples. The stucture of how AI, for example chatGPT allows me to skip and scroll wherever I want. Because it is efficient, One could be tempted to not read the documentation. 

### IV. Practical Applications:
Outside of 314, I believe that AI is something many people come across on the daily. Outside of 314, I use AI when I unlock my Iphone or when I am texting and my messages are autocorrected. I also use Maps and navigation to commute and that is another source of AI in which I incorporate in my day to day life. AI is helpful when it comes to collaborative efforts in working with others. 

### V. Challenges and Opportunities:


### VI. Comparative Analysis:


### VII. Future Considerations:


### VIII. Conclusion:
